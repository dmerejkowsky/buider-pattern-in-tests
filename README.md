# Builder pattern in tests

## Instructions

There's a bug in the production code but all tests pass!

Your first task is to find the bug and fix it, and understand
*why* it was not caught by the tests.

Your second task is to look up the *Builder* design pattern and
see if it can help.


[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) is a good source for a detailed explanation of the pattern.

You may start by implementing the design pattern
naively in the tests and use this as a starting point ... or
maybe find an other solution ?
